# **How to Choose the Best Siding for Your House in Los Angeles**

When we work on **home remodeling projects in Los Angeles**, one of the questions clients ask us most often at **Den Builders** is:

> *“What’s* *the* *best* *siding* *for* *my* *house?”*

The answer depends on your style, your budget, and how much time you
want to spend on maintenance. Over the years, we’ve installed and
repaired siding on homes from **Beverly** **Hills** **to** **Pasadena**,
and here’s what we’ve learned about the pros and cons of each option.

**1.** **Vinyl** **Siding** **–** **Affordable** **and** **Low**
**Maintenance**

If you’re looking for something budget-friendly and practical, **vinyl**
**siding** is often the first choice.

> ● ✅ **Pros:** Affordable, widely available, comes in many colors,
> resistant to termites, doesn’t need repainting.
>
> ● ❌ **Cons:** Can crack under extreme heat (and Los Angeles summers
> can be brutal). It also doesn’t always give the “luxury look” many
> homeowners in areas like **Beverly** **Hills** or **Malibu** want.

We’ve installed vinyl siding on homes in **Sherman** **Oaks** where the
homeowners wanted a quick, cost-effective facelift. It did the job
beautifully — but if you want your home to stand out in a high-end
neighborhood, you may want to consider other options.

**2.** **Wood** **Siding** **–** **Timeless** **and** **Classic**

Nothing beats the charm of natural **wood** **siding**. It gives a warm,
traditional feel that works especially well on **Craftsman** **homes**
**in** **Pasadena** or **bungalows** **in** **Santa** **Monica**.

> ● ✅ **Pros:** Beautiful and customizable. You can stain or paint it
> any way you like. It ages gracefully if properly maintained.
>
> ● ❌ **Cons:** High maintenance. Needs regular sealing or repainting.
> Vulnerable to termites and moisture damage.

We once worked on a remodel in **Brentwood** where the client chose
cedar siding for its natural beauty. It looked incredible — but we were
upfront about the ongoing maintenance it would require.

**3.** **Fiber** **Cement** **Siding** **–** **Durable** **and**
**Stylish**

One of our favorite choices for Los Angeles homeowners is **fiber**
**cement** **siding** (like James Hardie).

> ● ✅ **Pros:** Extremely durable, fire-resistant (a big plus in
> California), resistant to termites and rot, and it can mimic the look
> of wood or stucco.
>
> ● ❌ **Cons:** Heavier and more expensive than vinyl. Requires
> professional installation.

We recently recommended fiber cement siding to a homeowner in
**Hollywood** **Hills** who wanted a modern look with low maintenance.
It gave their home a sleek finish and peace of mind during fire season.

**4.** **Stucco** **–** **A** **California** **Classic**

Drive through neighborhoods like **Malibu** **or** **Beverly**
**Hills**, and you’ll see plenty of **stucco** **homes**. It’s a staple
in Southern California architecture.

> ● ✅ **Pros:** Works perfectly in dry, sunny climates. Long-lasting.
> Pairs beautifully with Spanish, Mediterranean, and modern styles.
>
> ● ❌ **Cons:** Can crack if not applied correctly. Not ideal for very
> humid environments.

At Den Builders, we’ve repaired and applied stucco on many homes, and
when done right, it can last for decades. But quality really matters —
bad stucco work is obvious and costly to fix.

**5.** **Metal** **Siding** **–** **Modern** **and** **Bold**

For homeowners who want something unique, **metal** **siding** (steel or
aluminum) is becoming more popular, especially in modern architectural
designs.

> ● ✅ **Pros:** Extremely durable, low maintenance, fire-resistant, and
> very modern in appearance.
>
> ● ❌ **Cons:** Higher cost, not always suited for traditional homes,
> dents can be hard to repair.

We used metal siding on a custom project in **Downtown** **Los**
**Angeles**, and it gave the house a striking, industrial vibe. Perfect
for someone who wants their home to stand out.

**So,** **What’s** **the** **Best** **Siding** **for** **Los**
**Angeles** **Homes?**

Here’s what we usually recommend at Den Builders, based on where you
live and your lifestyle:

> ● In **Sherman** **Oaks** **or** **Pasadena**, where budget matters →
> vinyl or fiber cement.
>
> ● In **Beverly** **Hills** **or** **Malibu**, where aesthetics and
> luxury are key → wood or stucco.
>
> ● In **Hollywood** **Hills**, where fire resistance is critical →
> fiber cement or metal siding.

✅ **Bottom** **Line:** The best siding for your house isn’t about one
“perfect” material. It’s about balancing **durability,**
**maintenance,** **style,** **and** **budget**. At **Den** **Builders**,
we help homeowners in Los Angeles choose siding that not only protects
their home but also enhances its value and beauty — whether it’s a cozy
ADU in **Pasadena** or a luxury estate in **Beverly** **Hills**.
